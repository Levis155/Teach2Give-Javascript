# Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concepts of objects, which bundle data (properties) and behaviours(methods) together.

It promotes code reusability, modularity, and scalability.

## Key principles of Object-Oriented Programming

- **Encapsulation:** This is bundling data and methods into a single unit (object). For example, a _User_ object with _name,_ _email,_ and _login()_ method.
- **Abstraction:** Involves hiding implementation details and exposing only what is necessary. For example, A _Car_ object has a _start()_ method, but the user doesn't need to know how it works internally
- **Inheritance:** creating new objects based on existing ones. For example, A _Student_ class can inherit properties from a _Person_ class
- **Polymorphism:** objects can share the same method name but behave differently. For example, a _Shape_ class has a _draw()_ method, but _Circle_ and _Rectangle_ implement it differently.
